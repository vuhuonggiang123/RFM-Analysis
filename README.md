# RFM-Analysis
## Using RFM analysis to segment customers through Python programming
### 1. Introduction
SuperStore Company is a global retail company. So the company has many customers.

On the occasion of Christmas and New Year, the Marketing Department wants to run marketing campaigns to thank customers who have supported the company over the past time. As well as exploiting customers who have the potential to become loyal customers.

However, the Marketing Department has not yet been able to group each customer this year because the data set is too large to be processed manually like in previous years, so they asked the Data Analysis Department to segment customers to deploy each marketing program suitable for each customer group.

The Marketing Director also suggested using the RFM model, but in the past, when the company was small, the team could calculate and classify it themselves using Excel. Currently, the amount of data is too large, so they want the Data Department to build a flow to deploy Segmentation evaluation through Python programming.

### 2. Steps to approach
1. Prepare a data set suitable for the RFM model.
2. Determine how to calculate and calculate R, F, M scores for each customer.
_Note: Calculation date of R index is December 31, 2011"_
3. Provide a calculation method with scoring corresponding to a scale of 1 to 5 (Use the quintile method of Statistics)
4. Based on the classification table to segment customers
5. Visualize the number of segment sets with data dimensions 
6. Analyze the company's current status and give suggestions to the Marketing team
